# NLP: Downtown Coding SLC MeetUP
A hands-on demo of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the [Downtown Coding SLC MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/DowntownCodingSLC). These notebooks will give a high-level introduction to NLP in Python using [spaCy](spacy.io). The first notebook will give a quick introduction to spaCy and its basic usage. The second notebook will show how we can use spaCy to extract information from **clinical text** using spaCy and [cycontext](https://github.com/medspacy/cycontext).

Both notebooks are also available on Google Colab:
