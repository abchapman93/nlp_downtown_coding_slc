However, NLP can be used in many specialties, and each specific domain will be interested in different concepts and tasks. In this notebook, we'll look at a few examples of how NLP can be used in the **clinical** domain for clinical concept extraction.\n",

        "Healthcare is an **information rich** industry. Every time a patient sees a doctor, fills a prescription, or takes a test, data is generated and stored. Healthcare providers store their data in an **Electronic Health Record (EHR)**. The field of **Healthcare Informatics** deals with how to manage this data and use it to make decisions regarding patient care, clinical research, and healthcare operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "One important type of data stored in the EHR is **clinical text**. These are free-text narratives which include very detailed and rich information about a patient's treatment. That makes it an excellent target of NLP. However, the language used in clinical text is notoriously complex and difficult to understand, and it is often very challenging to extract relevant information for EHR text.\n",

        "In this botebook, we'll look at how a pre-trained statistical model can extract clinical concepts such as problems, treatments, and tests. Next, we'll see how to write rules to supplement this statistical model. Finally, we'll use the [**cycontext**](https://github.com/medspacy/cycontext) package to detect negation, temporality, uncertainty, and family history."
